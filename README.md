Google Sky Map port for Google Glass XE

Since Sky Map is open source, I got curious as to how well it would run on Glass, which led me to where we are now.  Initially all you could do was look around but that has since changed.

Features Working:
 *   Terms and Conditions
 *   All sensors work perfectly
 *   Zoom (Swipe slowly from left to right to zoom in or out)
 *   Tap once to open up the options.  This will give you the ability to enter the preferences and edit the layers etc.
 *   Swipe down is the "back button"
 *   Added confirm on exit as I found I kept accidentally closing the app out.

Features Not Yet Working:
 *   Search (Need to figure out how to implement voice search)
 *   TimeWarp (The popup needs to be reconfigured for glass and then that feature should be usable)
 *   Gallery (This is a little used feature so I am not worrying too much about it)
